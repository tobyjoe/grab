Grab - Github Releases are Bitchin'
---

I got this idea from an issue in the [Apex](https://github.com/apex/apex) project.
Though not exactly what @tj had [in mind](https://github.com/apex/apex/issues/199), I figured I'd timebox myself on my morning commute and write a little util to grab recent releases from a Github project, and install them.


This is probably dodgy on Windows and BSD systems - I don't have any handy to test at the moment.

It's also basically a big script crammed into a Go file.

Contributions welcome.
